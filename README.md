# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Our purpose for this project is to help Louise differentiate which crowdfunded Kickstarter Campaigns have the best outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. When Louise came close to her own play's fundraising goal in such a small amount of time, she wanted to know how other campaigns compared. By doing so, we will visualize the outcomes so Louise will be able to see how other campaigns performed. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Taking a look at the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart above, the highest rate of successful campaigns kicked off in March and went through May. From May on, we see a steady decline in the success of the other campaigns through the end of the year. While the month of October saw a slight uptick in successful campaigns, they also had almost an equal amount of failed campaigns. The worst time to start a campaign is between November to January. This confirms that the best time to start a Theater Crowdfunded Campaign is from March to May. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The majority of successful campaigns happened when the fundraising goal was typically under $5,000 with at least a 72% success rate. Once the campaign goal exceeds $5,000, the percentage of successful and failed campaigns are almost equal with a steady increase in failed campaigns until we reach $35,000. At this point, the success rate of the campaign jumps to 66%. Once we surpass the funding goal of $45,000,  failed campaigns begin to increase. As we approach higher fundraising goals, we start to see the total number of projects decreasing with an increase of failed campaigns taking the lead over successful ones. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One challenge the Kickstarter campaigns face is gathering enough backers to pledge and make the fundraising goal. There seems to be a strong correlation between the amount of backers a campaign has which will determine if that campaign ends up being successful. When we look at the amount of backers the failed campaigns have and compare this to the amount the successful campaigns have, the amount is significantly lower. As a result, they are not able to hit their funding goals which turns it in to a failed campaign.  

## Results

The first conclusion we can draw is that the launch date of the campaign matters. When the launch is set between March and May, the campaign has a higher rate of success compared to launching it later in the year. The second conclusion is not to start a campaign between November to January. This is when you are least likely to have a successful campaign. 

What we can conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals, is that when a Kickstarter campaign has a funding goal of less than $5,000, that goal is more likely to be achieved. Once the fundraising goal amount increases, the goal will be harder to achieve. 

One limitation of this data set is how it is decided for how long a campaign will be open for fundraising. Some campaigns seem to have more time to achieve their goals while others do not. 

To further analyze the dataset, we can create a chart comparing other categories to the theater and play category. This would help us to see how they compare with their fundraising goals, launch dates, and how long the campaign was running.
