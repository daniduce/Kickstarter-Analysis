# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Our purpose for this project is to help Louise differentiate which crowdfunded Kickstarter Campaigns have the best outcomes based on their launch dates and on their funding goals. By doing so, we will visualize the outcomes so Louise will be able to see how other campaigns performed.   

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Taking a look at the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart above, the highest rate of successful campaigns kicked off in March and went through May. From May on, we see a steady decline in the success of the other campaignes through the end of the year. While the month of October saw a slight uptick in successful campaigns, the amount of failed campaigns. This confirms that the best time to start a Theater Crowdfunded Campaign is from March to May. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
